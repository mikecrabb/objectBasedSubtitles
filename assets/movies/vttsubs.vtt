WEBVTT

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.776
Arduino started as a project

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.259
that we did at the Interaction
Design Institute Ivrea...

00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:58.456
back in 2005

00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:02.776
But it has some roots in previous
projects that we worked on

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.339
Cause we wanted to make a tool
for our students that was more

00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:11.339
modern that what was available
on the market at the moment

00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:13.859
Specially because the tool that
everybody was using,

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:15.380
this thing called the BASIC Stamp,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.380
in Italy it was costing, at the
time, about 76€, that's like 100$

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.179
so it was very expensive
for the students

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:25.339
They wouldn't do any...
too much work

00:01:25.589 --> 00:01:27.779
because they didn't want to
spend money on buying

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:31.339
many boards that expensive,
so what happened...

00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:33.979
we started to look at possible
alternatives, and also we

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.740
were working on Processing,
the Processing language

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.139
because Casey Reas, one of the
founders, was one of the teachers

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:43.339
in Ivrea, so we thought: "Why
don't we try to figure out

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:46.219
how to make Processing for the
hardware?" So we worked with

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.339
a student who did a thesis on
the topic, and that produced a

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:56.339
wiring platform. Hernando
Barragán, a Colombian student,

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:59.499
worked on it. And then after
Hernando made Wiring

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:02.859
we started to figure out how
could we make the whole platform

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.619
even simpler, even cheaper,
even easier to use.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.980
And then we started to essentialy
reimplement the whole thing

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.860
as an open source project. We
wanted it to be open source

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.059
so that everybody could come
and help, and contribute.

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:22.620
Then we had another issue: that
there was a lot of discussion

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.140
about the school closing, so
we decided: "OK, let's try

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.539
to make this platform and open
it up as much as possible."

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:33.669
Then we stopped talking about
what we would like to have

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.589
and started talking about
how to do it.

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:39.069
And when we started talking
about how to do it, Massimo

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.309
had been experimenting
with some technology,

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:43.669
I had been experimenting
with a different technology...

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.028
We had a talk to decide
what was best and I decided

00:02:51.278 --> 00:02:53.628
to try this technology
Massimo had,

00:02:53.884 --> 00:02:57.789
because of its
better compatibility

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:59.809
with different OS.

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.389
I checked the hardware, found
a couple bugs, we fixed that,

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:08.589
and well, we started
making boards...

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:10.789
I mean, the process from starting
to seriously work on it

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.989
to having a board was
a mere two-day one.

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.709
All the rest was software.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.340
While I was kind of in
the middle of this I met with

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:26.139
David Cuartielles, who started to
sort of help me in the project,

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.699
then became a major contributor,
and then together we kind of made

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:35.780
the first Arduino hardware; then
we had David Mellis joining as

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.620
a student to write the software,
then Tom came in as an advisor,

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.940
and finally then Gianluca came
in as the person who was able

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.819
to manufacture the board, that's
how the team kind of formed,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.039
by adding people by their skills.

00:04:02.728 --> 00:04:06.809
We've been using Wiring boards
and wanted to port

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:11.408
a bunch of programs to a cheaper
microprocessor, basically,

00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:17.608
to install in some installations;
and I helped write like

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:20.248
a lot of compatibility layers so
that all the old programs

00:04:20.498 --> 00:04:25.688
could run in the new processor...
And then just being in Ivrea

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.128
and not wanting to spend too
much time on my actual thesis

00:04:29.378 --> 00:04:31.400
I spent more and more time like
working with Massimo

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.349
and the other guys
developing Arduino.

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.120
I knew there was
this development of this

00:04:36.837 --> 00:04:40.450
hardware equivalent to
Processing. And I went over

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.808
to Ivrea in June of 2005 to do a
workshop with them on another

00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:48.527
subject, and they showed me the
Arduino board at that point.

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:51.888
And I looked at it and I said:
"You know, this is great, and it

00:04:52.138 --> 00:04:54.248
definitely works for your school,
works for my school too, but

00:04:54.498 --> 00:04:58.008
I think it could be a larger
thing, and I think more people

00:04:58.258 --> 00:05:00.287
would want to use this." And
Massimo said: "Well, that's good

00:05:00.537 --> 00:05:03.248
feedback, thanks." And then I
went back to the States,

00:05:03.498 --> 00:05:05.969
and a couple weeks later they
wrote to me and said:

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:09.369
"You know, we want to go further
with this, and we want to try and

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:11.248
get it to the larger world.
Do you want to join us

00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:14.568
as part of the team?" And I said
"Yeah". And it was just...

00:05:14.818 --> 00:05:17.445
for me it was a case that
this is a tool I could see

00:05:17.695 --> 00:05:20.489
using myself, and therefore I
could believe in actually

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:22.758
helping to get it out
to a wider world.

00:05:23.087 --> 00:05:27.008
After the first prototyping
there was the need,

00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:30.688
or the desire, to start
manufacturing something

00:05:30.938 --> 00:05:35.969
in a more professional way,
and in a more commercial way.

00:05:36.438 --> 00:05:42.128
because all the first example was
mounted, was done just to make...

00:05:42.378 --> 00:05:47.926
to let them work. After
Massimo and David decided

00:05:48.176 --> 00:05:51.847
and understood the prototype
was working they needed to

00:05:52.097 --> 00:05:57.527
make a bigger batch. So we
decided to work on 200 units

00:05:58.087 --> 00:06:02.888
and we made... I made a little
redesign, a little

00:06:03.138 --> 00:06:06.087
design for manufacturing
in order to produce them.

00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:11.568
It was a test; they agreed
with their school

00:06:11.818 --> 00:06:17.328
the Interaction Design institute,
and the K3 of Malmö,

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:21.647
to buy 50 each. That was a
good starting point;

00:06:21.897 --> 00:06:25.888
that means we will not lose
all the money but at least

00:06:26.138 --> 00:06:31.008
half was coming back. The
selling price was exactly

00:06:31.258 --> 00:06:36.328
what we paid; I think we earned
1€ for each board, that is

00:06:36.578 --> 00:06:40.527
nothing considering all the
effort we put inside.

00:06:41.888 --> 00:06:47.167
But after some advertisement,
after some speaking with friends,

00:06:47.527 --> 00:06:52.445
this movement started to move.
And so we received the first

00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:57.207
call, our first customer, asking
for one board, it was a friend

00:06:57.457 --> 00:07:00.296
of Massimo and David. But this
was the beginning of something.

00:07:00.546 --> 00:07:04.587
A few months after meeting he
said "Hey Nate SparkFun, you guys

00:07:04.837 --> 00:07:07.703
should carry this thing called
Arduino." And I looked at it and

00:07:07.953 --> 00:07:11.703
at that time it was the through
hole version, the RS-232 version,

00:07:11.953 --> 00:07:14.453
and I said "This looks very
interesting" but I didn't really

00:07:14.703 --> 00:07:18.347
understand it. And... I hadn't
wrapped my head around it.

00:07:18.597 --> 00:07:20.587
And so I said: "You know, Tom,
I don't think it's for us, we don't

00:07:20.837 --> 00:07:22.825
really do kits, we're not sure
how people are going to react

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:26.669
to this" and so I decided
against it. It was a few months

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:29.287
later, six, seven months later,
that Arduino came out with

00:07:29.537 --> 00:07:33.107
the full USB version, fully
assembled and tested and

00:07:33.357 --> 00:07:35.087
ready to go, and Tom again
came to ask and said:

00:07:35.337 --> 00:07:37.736
"Hey, SparkFun, you should
really carry this." And I said

00:07:37.986 --> 00:07:40.186
"OK, well, I'm not really sure,
you know, we'll bring in 20

00:07:40.436 --> 00:07:44.027
and see how they sell." And
that was the first 20 out of

00:07:44.277 --> 00:07:46.145
about 40,000 at this point.

00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:15.039
The first time we heard
about Arduino was

00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:19.549
when David Cuartielles came
to an activity called

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:23.320
"Thursdays at Medialab",
which actually was

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.860
the first session of that
still ongoing activity.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:33.335
So he keeps talking about stuff
and at the end, after 90 minutes

00:08:33.585 --> 00:08:37.297
of listening to all of
David's tales, he says

00:08:37.547 --> 00:08:39.617
he's involved in this
project, but it was a really

00:08:39.867 --> 00:08:44.018
small thing, you know?
And I thought "At last!

00:08:44.268 --> 00:08:45.900
Come on, David, why wasn't
this the first thing you said?"

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.760
I want to talk to you
about Arduino...

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:58.240
Arduino is the last project,
I finished it last week.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.640
I talked to Ivrea's technical
director and told him:

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.120
Wouldn't it be great to do
something we can offer for free?

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.880
- For free?
- Yeah.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.400
And after that, well, we
worked with Gustavo, and

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.520
also kept in touch with
David, and we

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:23.880
organized an Arduino
workshop in October 2005,

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.640
which was one of the
first Arduino workshops,

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.600
if not the first one ever...

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:35.817
On the last day David proposed
creating some small prototypes.

00:09:36.067 --> 00:09:38.817
He called it "Bring your old junk
and let's do something with it."

00:09:39.067 --> 00:09:42.760
That led to some quite
interesting projects...

00:09:43.086 --> 00:09:46.197
And these people kept on
doing small electronic

00:09:46.447 --> 00:09:49.447
instruments, small robots...

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:55.824
At the time I was senior editor
at MAKE, MAKE was only

00:09:56.074 --> 00:09:59.532
a couple years old, and I had
heard about this Arduino project.

00:09:59.782 --> 00:10:02.543
And I saw it online and I said:
"Well, a lot of people are

00:10:02.793 --> 00:10:04.906
starting to talk about this,
I should check it out."

00:10:05.156 --> 00:10:07.984
And I got one of the boards and
said "Whoa, this is fantastic,

00:10:08.234 --> 00:10:11.032
beginners are gona love this. It
runs on Mac, it runs on PC, it

00:10:11.282 --> 00:10:13.661
runs on Linux... this is exactly
what everyone wants."

00:10:13.911 --> 00:10:16.382
At the time a lot of people were
using BASIC Stamps, were using

00:10:16.632 --> 00:10:20.185
all sorts of microcontrollers,
and I come from using design

00:10:20.435 --> 00:10:22.743
tools like Flash and Processing,
and I'm like "Oh, this is

00:10:22.993 --> 00:10:24.964
perfect, it's exactly what I
think everyone's going to

00:10:25.214 --> 00:10:28.224
want." And this was in the
beginning of when MAKE

00:10:28.474 --> 00:10:31.945
was starting to have a store,
and so it took a little while

00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:34.782
and you know, it's very hard to
do international money transfers.

00:10:35.032 --> 00:10:37.864
Basically we started selling
Arduinos in MAKE right away,

00:10:38.114 --> 00:10:42.139
And then later on, when I
started working with Limor,

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:45.165
who's part of Adafruit,
she's a founder, we also

00:10:45.415 --> 00:10:48.224
said right away "This is a
fantastic tool for getting

00:10:48.474 --> 00:10:51.426
people doing the things that they
want to do with electronics."

00:10:51.676 --> 00:10:53.984
Not necessarily learning
everything first, but getting

00:10:54.234 --> 00:10:56.536
the application done, like
I want something... I want

00:10:56.786 --> 00:11:00.264
my dress to blink. Very hard
to do if you just want to learn

00:11:00.514 --> 00:11:02.984
electronics; with an Arduino you
get that done in a few minutes.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.680
Just turn the confetti video...

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.000
So this is sort like a demo bay.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.880
We have a number of our
projects set up

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.300
This was a project we did
for a single night event

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.500
that used Arduino as sensors

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.680
and the way it works,
we made these

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.800
giant maracas that when
you shake them,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.900
it creates this explosion
of confetti, and

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.850
in the original install it was
on a giant sphere, but here...

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.080
Each one of these has an
accelerometer in it

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.120
and a Bluetooth controller
sending it to the computer

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.200
and then we generate
these graphics.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.360
And it's all related to an
specific event

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.200
where we wanted people
to lighten up, it was at

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.840
a cocktail party, and we wanted
people to really let loose,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.760
and feel more free.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.040
And I wished to show you the
Luminodes project over here...

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.000
This was a project we did
early on in the lab,

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.160
thinking about networked
lighting,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.960
and the way it works is
there's sort of a family

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.920
of lights, and the main light
here, you pick it up

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.600
and you can sort of tune
the color by twisting it.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:43.560
It will set the color, and these
others are sort of children...

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.120
As the user plays with them
they all sort of come into sync.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.400
So we're really into social
relationships that people create

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.480
through technology.
So in this case it was

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.850
sort of syncing a number
of people up who were all

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.600
using the same thing. And
then we extended it out to

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.350
use architectural
scale lighting and

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.140
and off-the-shelf
lighting equipment.

00:13:02.046 --> 00:13:04.317
The very first thing I tried
to do with an Arduino

00:13:04.567 --> 00:13:08.197
was to run a 3D printer on an
Arduino. Which...

00:13:08.447 --> 00:13:10.916
I probably should have started
out with something simpler,

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:14.296
because it was really difficult,
and I didn't know anything

00:13:14.546 --> 00:13:18.846
about electronics. It was just
like stumbling blindly and trying

00:13:19.096 --> 00:13:23.637
to get it to work, but eventually
I got it to work, and now

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:27.835
we sell these MakerBot 3D
printers which actually run on...

00:13:28.197 --> 00:13:30.450
There's multiple Arduinos in
the machine.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.280
So this is a 3D printer,

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:38.097
and what that means is it takes
a 3D model from... you can

00:13:38.347 --> 00:13:40.936
download one from the internet,
or design it yourself, or

00:13:41.186 --> 00:13:46.097
scan in a 3D model of an object;
and then it prints with plastic,

00:13:46.347 --> 00:13:49.897
so this right here is a filament,
and so what happens is

00:13:50.147 --> 00:13:54.176
this plastic is slowly pulled
down into the extruder head here

00:13:54.426 --> 00:13:59.336
and when it's done you'll get a
real object that is exactly

00:13:59.586 --> 00:14:01.420
what you wanted.
So you have a digital

00:14:01.845 --> 00:14:06.240
file that you give it, and you
basically say "make me one

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:09.496
of this", you hit print, and this
machine will make it for you.

00:14:09.746 --> 00:14:13.576
It will make one, or a hundred,
or 1,000 of them if you want.

00:14:13.896 --> 00:14:18.138
Which is great, because there's
all sorts of cool open source

00:14:18.388 --> 00:14:20.795
things that this will make for
you. So you don't need to have

00:14:21.045 --> 00:14:24.616
a laser cutter, or a PCB
fabrication thing to really

00:14:24.866 --> 00:14:27.576
participate in open source
hardware. You can just design

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:30.816
something, this will sit on your
desk and print you out stuff.

00:14:32.776 --> 00:14:36.138
One of the things I really like
about this is that this allows

00:14:36.388 --> 00:14:39.415
you to apply the idea of open
source hardware to things

00:14:39.665 --> 00:14:42.696
that are very very basic, that
you would not otherwise

00:14:42.946 --> 00:14:45.656
consider to be open source
hardwares. So we have...

00:14:45.906 --> 00:14:48.055
There's an open source
whistle, for example.

00:14:48.305 --> 00:14:51.857
There's an open source bottle
opener... Over here on the wall

00:14:53.107 --> 00:14:56.217
we have a... right here, there's
an open source coat hook.

00:14:56.467 --> 00:14:59.656
So we have a coat hook...
this is open source hardware.

00:15:00.006 --> 00:15:03.217
There's a file on the internet
you can download and

00:15:03.467 --> 00:15:05.576
if you have a 3D printer you
can print out as many

00:15:05.826 --> 00:15:09.045
coat hooks as you want, and
you don't have to pay anybody

00:15:10.336 --> 00:15:12.496
anything. If you want a bigger
coat hook you can make it bigger.

00:15:12.896 --> 00:15:17.896
And it is just this wonderful
idea that we can apply this idea

00:15:18.146 --> 00:15:21.616
of open source to all of these
common everyday things

00:15:21.866 --> 00:15:24.217
that we use in our life, like...
what we're trying to do is

00:15:24.467 --> 00:15:25.967
open source everything.

00:15:26.235 --> 00:15:29.696
What sort of can have been a
crazy idea 10 years ago,

00:15:29.946 --> 00:15:33.616
are now... actually there's a
path that we can take

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:37.295
to get there. And people are
starting to take it seriously.

00:15:37.795 --> 00:15:40.295
Open source hardware is a
fantastic way to make sure

00:15:40.545 --> 00:15:42.696
other people can look at your
designs and improve them.

00:15:42.946 --> 00:15:45.347
Open source hardware is a
fantastic way so you don't have

00:15:45.816 --> 00:15:48.576
to answer e-mails of people
asking "can they use something?"

00:15:48.826 --> 00:15:50.336
You've put the license out
there, you've said...

00:15:50.586 --> 00:15:53.217
Open source hardware for us
means you can take our stuff,

00:15:53.467 --> 00:15:55.347
you can do whatever you want
with it... you just have to do

00:15:55.597 --> 00:15:58.415
the same thing we did: release
it back, allow other people

00:15:58.665 --> 00:16:01.336
to do whatever they want with it
and they can sell it as long as

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:04.097
all the attribution, all the
credits, all things that you've

00:16:04.347 --> 00:16:07.376
requested, are respected. And
so far it's worked out great:

00:16:07.626 --> 00:16:09.996
If you look at Linux, it's a
perfect example. If you look

00:16:10.246 --> 00:16:13.977
at Apache, all these things that
run the web, it's all open source

00:16:14.227 --> 00:16:17.656
If you had to pay someone, or
talk to someone, or license

00:16:17.906 --> 00:16:19.776
something every time you wanted
to put up a website,

00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:22.996
we wouldn't have the fantastic
world of information sharing

00:16:23.246 --> 00:16:26.246
we do. So I look at Arduino as
a physical representation of

00:16:26.496 --> 00:16:28.138
all the great things you got
with open source software,

00:16:28.388 --> 00:16:30.097
but now starting to happen
in hardware.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.600
We will hit a level where
people will be creating...

00:16:34.586 --> 00:16:37.280
people will be creating hardware
on the same way that people

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.040
were creating books after
movable type became cheap and

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.400
easy to replicate. And I really
think that that's the level

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.750
of the open source hardware
revolution, as we are looking

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.760
at something like a Gutenberg
event, where movable type

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.100
will change how people read,
write and share information, only

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.080
in this case it will be how we
create and use physical objects.

00:16:54.115 --> 00:17:00.115
The idea behind having control
over these physical objects

00:17:00.365 --> 00:17:04.944
and being able to manipulate them
at will and not be afraid

00:17:05.194 --> 00:17:07.953
to take them apart, to see
what's inside, to really

00:17:08.203 --> 00:17:11.232
know everything that's going
on... That's something really

00:17:11.482 --> 00:17:12.982
behind the open source
hardware for me,

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:16.996
and something I'm really
passionate about.

00:17:17.496 --> 00:17:20.034
You know, of course open source
means that you are

00:17:20.284 --> 00:17:24.294
making it for the community
at large, based on work

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.476
that other people have
done. So it's kind of like I'm

00:17:26.726 --> 00:17:30.636
taking one step up a ladder, and
then I'm helping other people

00:17:30.886 --> 00:17:32.314
go further up the ladder.

00:17:32.564 --> 00:17:34.593
The current problem is that

00:17:34.843 --> 00:17:41.093
 because of both standardisation
and the patent system,

00:17:41.343 --> 00:17:44.756
a lot of people were left
without the possibility

00:17:45.006 --> 00:17:48.035
of learning how things work;
this ended up being

00:17:48.285 --> 00:17:51.394
possible only to a group
of people: the hackers,

00:17:51.644 --> 00:17:54.936
whose technical knowledge
allowed them... made them

00:17:55.186 --> 00:17:57.236
feel able of opening an
electronic element to see

00:17:57.876 --> 00:18:02.718
what it had inside. And that's
open source hardware for me:

00:18:02.968 --> 00:18:06.876
it means to once again
be able to check

00:18:07.126 --> 00:18:09.436
what is inside of stuff,
but in a way that is allowed,

00:18:09.686 --> 00:18:14.197
that is also ethically "right",

00:18:14.447 --> 00:18:17.316
legal, and that allows us to
improve the educative methods.

00:18:17.566 --> 00:18:19.957
All things considered, what
open hardware is for me

00:18:20.207 --> 00:18:22.747
is a system that makes people
able to learn about the way

00:18:22.997 --> 00:18:25.447
things work in this world
we live in, where there are

00:18:25.697 --> 00:18:28.556
more computers than
people. So we need to

00:18:28.806 --> 00:18:30.997
understand how our stuff
works, not only for being able

00:18:31.247 --> 00:18:33.046
to repair it, but also to
understand how our own

00:18:33.296 --> 00:18:35.757
life works. And I thing that
is really necessary nowadays.

00:18:36.316 --> 00:18:42.277
At the beginning, on the whole
question of open source

00:18:42.527 --> 00:18:47.676
hardware versus open hardware,
open source, it's still very

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:53.876
a very complex situation, there's
still not very defined standards

00:18:54.126 --> 00:18:57.638
or licenses or processes...
For us at the beginning

00:18:57.888 --> 00:19:02.095
it was a specific need: we knew
the school was closing, and we

00:19:02.345 --> 00:19:05.394
and we were afraid that lawyers
would show up one day and say

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:09.797
"Everything here goes into a box
and gets forgotten about."

00:19:10.047 --> 00:19:12.995
So we thougt "OK, if we open
everything about this,

00:19:13.245 --> 00:19:17.275
then we can survive the
closing of the school."

00:19:17.525 --> 00:19:19.874
So that was the first step.
Then we started to figure out

00:19:20.124 --> 00:19:24.236
that there was a way to get a
very nice ecosystem of people

00:19:24.486 --> 00:19:27.295
participating and making
extensions, making derivatives,

00:19:27.545 --> 00:19:30.990
and helping. And then our
activity of talking to

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.874
manufacturers, and making
them to build things,

00:19:34.124 --> 00:19:37.634
became an interesting study
on how there could be

00:19:37.884 --> 00:19:40.556
a business model that would
apply to open source.

00:19:40.806 --> 00:19:44.919
For us it was really important,
as a cultural space

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:49.316
for experimentation, to try
and apply the logic of

00:19:49.566 --> 00:19:52.237
free tools to the
actual process of working.

00:19:52.487 --> 00:19:56.095
That was the idea behind
"Interactivos?", a space

00:19:56.345 --> 00:19:58.278
where people could develop
their own projects but where

00:19:58.528 --> 00:20:01.278
other people could also
get involved in them

00:20:01.528 --> 00:20:03.997
as collaborators. Because
the process is open for

00:20:04.247 --> 00:20:09.078
anyone to participate.
That is, for us, a quite...

00:20:09.328 --> 00:20:15.394
how to say it, a strong
relationship; we feel that

00:20:15.644 --> 00:20:20.278
we are always trying to get
inspiration from something

00:20:20.528 --> 00:20:23.556
as surprising as all free
software processes are,

00:20:23.806 --> 00:20:26.247
and in this case... we had never
heard about the existance of

00:20:26.497 --> 00:20:31.797
"free hardware". So all started
buzzing with possibilities

00:20:32.047 --> 00:20:35.115
that went in all kind
of directions.

00:20:35.365 --> 00:20:38.797
I love open source hardware.
I think everything should be

00:20:39.047 --> 00:20:41.997
that way. It's great for
education, I like sharing

00:20:42.247 --> 00:20:44.919
what we've learned, and it's
easy for the kids to find out

00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:49.037
more and it would be great if
they could build their own things

00:20:49.698 --> 00:20:53.163
I did not learn
microcontrollers until my

00:20:53.413 --> 00:20:55.806
middle years in college, til
the end of college.

00:20:56.056 --> 00:20:59.968
And I was really blown away
by how easy it was to use

00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:02.968
Arduino, namely, being the
forerunner development board.

00:21:03.218 --> 00:21:09.144
I think, given the right series
of events, and if Arduino and

00:21:09.394 --> 00:21:12.766
electronics could be taught in
high school, I think there's a

00:21:13.016 --> 00:21:16.968
big future for not only
engineers, but also artists.

00:21:17.566 --> 00:21:21.566
Also digital media interactive
design people. If they can learn

00:21:21.816 --> 00:21:23.845
that in high school, imagine
how much more they can do

00:21:24.095 --> 00:21:25.595
later in life.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.840
When the Arduino
sends the signal,

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.680
it controls exactly the same
these two buttons would.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.320
This is made for
recording and playing

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:10.400
when you manually touch
the keys. But if you put in

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.800
opto-isolators,
these two things here,

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.760
you can bridge the keys
through the controller

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.640
and activate them with an
electric signal that comes

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.440
from the controller,
that is programmed.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:27.200
That's why Arduino is
so powerful, because

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.840
you can control any
machine that works...

00:22:30.095 --> 00:22:33.948
It is an amazing tool
for giving young people

00:22:34.278 --> 00:22:39.037
this age get in contact
with all those...

00:22:39.287 --> 00:22:44.634
an awful lot of realities
they live in.

00:22:44.884 --> 00:22:49.556
First to get them to learn
that the consumer side

00:22:49.806 --> 00:22:53.355
-this "use the remote
with the machine" side-

00:22:53.605 --> 00:22:56.797
is not the only one;
that it is possible to

00:22:58.394 --> 00:23:04.394
understand what's inside
and get the control back.

00:23:04.644 --> 00:23:08.115
Because now all these kids
have a huge amount of

00:23:08.365 --> 00:23:12.997
gadgets which they have
no idea how they work at all.

00:23:14.095 --> 00:23:18.394
With Arduino you can get a
small glimpse of how all this

00:23:18.644 --> 00:23:22.316
stuff works, show them some
schematics that allow them to

00:23:22.566 --> 00:23:25.678
have a certain way
of looking at all

00:23:25.928 --> 00:23:27.595
the technological world that
is going to surround them.

00:23:27.845 --> 00:23:33.316
And it is also quite funny,
can be used to teach electronics,

00:23:33.566 --> 00:23:37.556
to teach them how to think,
it teaches them how to have

00:23:37.806 --> 00:23:39.845
less short-term projects
and work as a team,

00:23:40.095 --> 00:23:43.595
how to participate in a
community, get information...

00:23:45.237 --> 00:23:47.095
The potential for students
when they're just learning

00:23:47.345 --> 00:23:49.394
how to use the computer, to
learn how to make things

00:23:49.644 --> 00:23:53.355
with computers... to me that...
that's powerful.

00:23:53.605 --> 00:23:56.478
And what that would
actually mean long term

00:23:56.728 --> 00:24:02.728
for students with only 50$,
be able to plug something

00:24:02.978 --> 00:24:04.756
into their computer and
make something with it

00:24:05.006 --> 00:24:07.115
over and over and over again
and then really share it...

00:24:07.997 --> 00:24:13.198
The type of creative community
that can engender in young people

00:24:13.448 --> 00:24:17.835
to me I think that is... That's
going to change everything,

00:24:18.085 --> 00:24:21.678
and I'm really excited to see
what happens as it develops.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.790
Arduino has 120.000
users nowadays,

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.595
or 130.000 users...
I just count the number

00:24:35.845 --> 00:24:39.198
of sold boards. The traffic
that we are now getting

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:44.634
in our website is close
to 15 million hits per month.

00:24:44.884 --> 00:24:49.198
Which means around
600.000 hits per day.

00:24:49.448 --> 00:24:53.997
That is knowing it is actively
used in universities,

00:24:54.247 --> 00:24:56.237
also used by people who work
on their personal projects...

00:24:56.487 --> 00:24:58.640
Now imagine it was to
start being used

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.520
in high school education.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.120
Its future will not
be "technological",

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.600
it will be quite more social;

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.880
it will be some kind of
big boom where a lot

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.000
of people will start
using it.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.080
I definitely see Arduino
taking one path of

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.120
being just very easy to use,
even easier than it is now.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.920
So making it easier for
beginners to get into it.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.520
All my favourite distortion
pedals... a Big Muff...

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:45.120
with my favourite
microcontroller board, Arduino.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.800
The user base would get
10 or 20 times bigger.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.080
If all of a sudden these
people started sharing

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.800
their files on the network,
it would just not support all that.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.680
It would just not work.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.200
Here's a robot.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.600
If I tilt, you see the light
goes left... I go up...

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.080
I want Arduino to always
be a tool that people

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.800
who have no understanding
of computers can look at

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.560
and can get an understanding
of how a computer works.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.600
But I sell this. So that's part
of how I make my living.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.120
For this to keep working like
it does ten years for now

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.120
we need to be able to keep
creating new hardware,

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.440
we will need the continous
feedback of the community,

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:47.600
and to be able to include
their changes and

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.760
their proposals with all
the necessary upgrades.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.560
And after those 10 years,
I hope we have

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.400
at least one Arduino
computer... why not?
